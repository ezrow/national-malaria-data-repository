Welcome to the repository for the **National Malaria Data Repository (NMDR) Guidance**. This page serves as a centralized, version-controlled space for countries, partners, and technical teams to access and adapt tools, templates, and supporting materials needed to plan, implement, and sustain an NMDR.

## 📖 About the NMDR and Guidance Document

The **National Malaria Data Repository (NMDR)** is a centralized platform that brings together all relevant malaria data—routine surveillance, stock management, chemoprevention, entomology, surveys, and climate—into one structured system. Built on platforms like DHIS2, the NMDR enables national malaria programs to streamline fragmented data, enhance data quality, and make timely, evidence-based decisions at all levels of the health system. It improves integration, coordination, and use of data by linking siloed sources under one governance structure.

The **NMDR Guidance Document** provides countries with a practical roadmap to establish and scale up an NMDR. Grounded in real-world experiences and implementation lessons, the guidance includes planning and budgeting tools, metadata packages, readiness assessments, and module templates. Countries can follow a phased approach—planning, initial setup, module development, rollout, and institutionalization—using these tools to adapt to their specific context. This repository contains all annexes referenced in the guidance and is designed for continuous improvement.
